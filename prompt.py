        "CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON format. NO explanations, NO descriptions, NO additional text.\n\n"
        "GOAL:\n"
        "Extract each financial asset and, only if unambiguously visible, its current total valuation (position total value).\n\n"
        "OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n"
        "{{\"assets\": [{{\"<name_or_ISIN_raw>\": <number_or_null_or_percentage>}}, ...]}}\n\n"
        "STRICT RULES:\n"
        "1. Key = exact raw text of the asset line (preserve case, punctuation, accents; collapse multiple spaces into one). "
        "If a certain 12-character ISIN (letters+digits, last is check digit) appears for that line, use the ISIN (uppercase) as the key and NOT the name. "
        "Do not invent or normalize identifiers not shown. One key:value pair per object.\n"
        "2. Value = numeric total valuation ONLY if a single, clearly associated monetary total for that asset line is present (NOT unit price, NOT % change, NOT quantity, NOT cost basis). "
        "Normalize number: remove thousand separators ('.', ',', spaces), convert decimal comma to dot, output as JSON number (no quotes), ignore currency symbol. "
        "If no monetary total is present but the portfolio weight percentage is clearly shown and you are 100% sure this is the asset's weight in the portfolio, extract that percentage and write it with the '%' symbol (e.g., 25%). "
        "If multiple candidate percentages and you are 100% sure which is the percentage composition, or if only quantities/returns appear (often with '+' before) -> null. "
        "If multiple candidate monetary numbers and you are not 100% sure which is the valuation, or only quantities/return (they are often '+' before) appear -> null. "
        "If blank, '--', unreadable, or a crypto pair (non-fiat) -> null.\n"
        "3. Ignore headers (e.g. Totale, Quantity, P/L, Gain, Return, Valorizzazione, LiquiditÃ , Investimento), overall portfolio totals (e.g. Totale Portafoglio), dates, times, percentages, fees, unit prices, cost basis. Include 'Cash' only if clearly listed as a holding line (else ignore totals).\n"
        "4. Distinct lots of same asset -> separate objects (key may repeat). Repeated header/footer occurrences -> skip.\n"
        "5. If none found output {{\"assets\": []}}\n"
        "6. RESPOND WITH JSON ONLY. NO OTHER TEXT ALLOWED.\n\n"
        "EXAMPLE RESPONSE:\n"
        "{{\"assets\": [{{\"AAPL\": 1500}}, {{\"GOOGL\": null}}, {{\"MSFT\": 2340.50}}, {{\"US0378331005\": \"5%\"}}]}}\n\n"
